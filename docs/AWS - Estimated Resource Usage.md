## Estimated Resource Usage

To estimate the AWS costs, I'll make the following assumptions about the application's usage:

### 1. Amazon ECS (Fargate)
- **Baseline**: 2 Fargate tasks running continuously (24/7) for the backend application.
  - Each task: 0.5 vCPU, 1 GB memory.
- **Peak Usage**: During peak hours (e.g., 4 hours/day), assume 4 Fargate tasks running.

### 2. Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
- **Instance**: `db.t3.medium` instance running 24/7.
- **Storage**: 100 GB GP2 storage.
- **Multi-AZ**: Enabled for high availability (cost is typically ~2x single AZ).
- **Backups**: Automated backups included in storage cost or minimal additional cost.

### 3. Amazon S3
- **Frontend Assets**: Assume 1 GB of storage for the web application's static files.
- **Application Artifacts/Backups**: Assume 10 GB of storage for application artifacts and database backups.
- **Data Transfer Out**: Assume 50 GB/month for data transfer from S3 (e.g., users downloading the web app).

### 4. Amazon CloudFront
- **Data Transfer Out**: Assume 100 GB/month for data transfer from CloudFront (CDN for web app).
- **Requests**: Assume 10 million HTTP/HTTPS requests per month.

### 5. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Running Time**: 24/7 operation.
- **LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Units)**: Assume an average of 5 LCUs per month.

### 6. AWS KMS
- **Key Usage**: Minimal, assume 10,000 requests per month.

### 7. AWS Secrets Manager
- **Secrets**: 1 secret (database credentials).
- **API Calls**: Minimal, assume 1,000 API calls per month.

### 8. Amazon CloudWatch
- **Metrics**: Standard metrics, assume 1,000 custom metrics.
- **Logs**: Assume 10 GB of log data ingested per month.

### 9. AWS WAF
- **Web ACLs**: 1 Web ACL.
- **Rules**: 10 rules.
- **Requests**: Assume 10 million requests processed per month.

These assumptions provide a basis for calculating the monthly cost. The next step is to use AWS pricing information to calculate the costs for each service.
