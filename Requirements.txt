Meal Ordering Application: 
Requirements & Specification

1. Introduction
    This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for an inflight ordering application. The application aims to provide a seamless ordering experience for both crew and passengers, with a strong emphasis on offline capabilities, data synchronization, and security.

2. Functional Requirements
    2.1 Order Management
        FR1.1 Create/Modify Orders: Users (crew/passengers) shall be able to create new orders and modify existing ones.
        FR1.2 Validate Combos/Substitutions: The system shall validate order items for valid combinations and allowed substitutions.
        FR1.3 Update Seat/Inventory Locally: The system shall allow local updates to seat assignments and inventory levels.
    2.2 Synchronization
        FR2.1 Lossless Sync on Landing: The application shall perform lossless synchronization with the Core Reservation System (CRS) upon landing.
        FR2.2 Idempotent Synchronization: Synchronization operations shall be idempotent, ensuring consistent state even with repeated attempts.
        FR2.3 Conflict-Aware Synchronization: The system shall detect and handle conflicts during synchronization with the CRS.
    2.3 Passenger Confirmation
        FR3.1 Confirmation after CRS Acceptance: Passengers shall receive a confirmation of their order after successful acceptance by the CRS.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
    3.1 Performance
        NFR1.1 Offline Responsiveness: The application shall remain fully functional and responsive even when offline.
        NFR1.2 Synchronization Speed: Synchronization with CRS shall be efficient and complete within acceptable timeframes upon landing.
    3.2 Scalability
        NFR2.1 User Load: The application shall support a large number of concurrent users (crew and passengers) on a single flight.
    3.3 Security & PII
        NFR3.1 Device Provisioning: The application shall support secure device provisioning for crew devices.
        NFR3.2 Encrypted at Rest: All sensitive data, especially PII, shall be encrypted when stored on the device.
        NFR3.3 Least Privilege: The application shall operate with the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions.
        NFR3.4 Audit Trails: The system shall maintain comprehensive audit trails for all critical operations, especially those involving PII.
    3.4 Cross-Platform Compatibility
        NFR4.1 Platform Support: The application shall work seamlessly on phone, tablet, and laptop devices (crew devices; passengers could also order).
        NFR4.2 Same Domain Code: The core domain logic shall be shared across all platforms.
        NFR4.3 Platform-Specific UIs: User interfaces shall be tailored to each platform (phone, tablet, laptop) for optimal user experience.
    3.5 Maintainability
        NFR5.1 Modularity: The codebase shall be modular and well-structured to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance.
        NFR5.2 Testability: The application components shall be easily testable to ensure reliability and correctness.
